## Crowdsourcing

## Popcorn Hack:
> Answer: Optimizing crowdsourcing involves refining task design, incentivizing participation, and leveraging diverse expertise to enhance collective problem-solving.

## Question 1:
Crowdsourcing means getting help from many people to reach a goal. Businesses ask for ideas (like InnoCentive), scientists get help with tasks (like Zooniverse), tech folks work together on software (like GitHub), artists join contests (like 99designs), and maps are improved (like OpenStreetMap).

## Question 2:
Crowdsourcing is good because it brings different ideas, saves money, speeds up new things, and permits people feel involved. Yet sometimes, it is difficult to control quality, share ideas fairly, and manage a lot of people. To do it well, you need clear goals, incentives, good checks, a friendly community, and solutions for sharing ideas.

## Question 3:
A famous example is from 2011, when players cracked a difficult problem about an AIDS enzyme. It showed how everyone working together can solve complicated science problems. The origin of this discovery was the "Foldit" project, created by the University of Washington. The project turns the problem of protein folding into a game, allowing players to manipulate protein structures.

## Question 4:
For example, a city may be struggling to monitor air quality (smog levels). An easy app can be created for smartphones where people can share air data. People use their phones to check and share air info. Others check if it's accurate, and experts can study the data for research purposes. Communities can then work with leaders to create legislation that targets the air quality.
