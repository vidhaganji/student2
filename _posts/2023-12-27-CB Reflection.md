# Test Corrections Reflection: 58/67

I made three silly mistakes (accidental clicks), and 6 questions were ones I genuinely got wrong. The correction for these questions are below â€“

1. **Museum Tickets:**
   A misinterpretation of code resulted in an error. I forgot to separate age and tour conditions into two distinct if statements. To avoid mistakes like these, I will look through all the answer choices before deciding that one of them is correct.

2. **Compare Output Question:**
   I made a mistake here because I assumed that 'i' resets to 1 with each loop restart, ignoring the repeating portion of the code. From now on, I will be more careful to understand the strcuture of loops. 

3. **Move Robot to Goal:**
   Forgetting that a conditional inside a loop must add up to something caused to an error. I did not  recognize the importance of the statement "CAN_MOVE (forward) = false" in the loop. From now, I will always carefully consider all answer options and their differences.

4. **Score Question:**
   Misunderstanding AND/OR statements led to an error. I selected option A, unaware that the presence of AND would evaluate the statement to false even if the score was within 10 points of the target. Being aware that option D correctly makes a 10-point guide would have made my answer correct.

5. **BotMover Question:**
   Lack of visualization resulted in an incorrect answer. Drawing out each option would have revealed that option B made the robot return to its original spot. I will practice 3D visualization by drawing it out from now on.

6. **Spinner Question:**
   Confusion between similar options resulted in an error. I incorrectly thought the larger portion should occur when spin = 1 due to the "Move 1 space" condition. When I looked at the question again, I realized  the correct answer was option D, considering the else statement's higher probability. To prevent similar errors, I will analyze pseudocode more thoroughly and write down the output of each option.

I will be sure to revise these concepts via rewatching the College Board daily videos, as well as, for a secondary source of learning, watch relevant videos on [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/). I think another good resource for me would be to review the Team Teaches and attempt the homework + popcorn hacks without the help of generative AI.
